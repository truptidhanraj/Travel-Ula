This is the only city in the World which boasts a National park within the city limits. 

After one hour you would climb up to The Great Rift Valley. This is one priced attraction of Kenya. Formed a millions years back, this valley boasts beautiful lakes and escarpments, which provide havens for plentiful wildlife. The Great Rift Valley runs for 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers), from Jordan in southwestern Asia to the coast of the Indian Ocean in central Mozambique.

This pride is called the  ‘Topi Pride’. Relax, sit back and enjoy God’s creations. You would be so excited to see the endless plains of Maasai Mara with its dwellers.
